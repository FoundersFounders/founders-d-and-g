# Founders D&G

[iOS app](app/) and [Siri Shortcuts](siri-shortcuts/) to open front and garage doors at [Founders Founders](http://www.founders-founders.com). This project is inspired by Founders Founders project [door-services](https://github.com/FoundersFounders/door-services).

## [iOS app](app/)

iOS 12 app for iPhone with Today Widget, Quick Actions (3D touch) and location-aware features. Siri integration and push notifications are not present, because they require a paid developer account. Nonetheless, the app is still helpful, simple and intuitive to allow a fast access to open the doors.

You can find more information about the app at [app/](app/).

## [Siri Shortcuts](siri-shortcuts/)

Unfortunately, Siri integration with the app is not currently possible, because it requires a personal developer account. However, iOS 12 allows to develop and share Siri Shortcuts. So, you can find at [siri-shortcuts/](siri-shortcuts/) multiple shortcuts for you to use with Siri!
